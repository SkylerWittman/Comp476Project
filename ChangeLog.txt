Eric (Mar 10)
TerrainEngine script rewritten
Spawner script added
Player prefab created
Tree colliders fixed
Zombies, dinos and goblins added

Still working on: making spawns a little smarter 
	Will be doing it grid based - terrain is chopped into 1000 blocks of 2x2
	No more than one object will be spawned per block
